## Library / Collection Analysis — use zotero_script(mode:'read')

When the user asks for a summary, overview, statistics, or analysis of their **whole library or a collection**, do NOT make multiple `query_library` calls to page through results. Each `query_library` call returns full metadata for every matching item, which quickly overflows the context window.

Instead, use a single `zotero_script(mode:'read')` call that iterates all items inside Zotero's runtime and aggregates the answer in one pass. The script runs locally — there is no context-size limitation because only the final `env.log()` output is returned to the conversation.

### Strategy
1. Write a `zotero_script(mode:'read')` script that:
   - Calls `Zotero.Items.getAll(env.libraryID, false, false, false)` to get all items.
   - Filters to `item.isRegularItem()` (skips attachments, notes, annotations).
   - Aggregates whatever the user asked for (counts by year, by type, by tag, top authors, collection sizes, etc.).
   - Calls `env.log()` with the aggregated result (compact JSON or readable text).
2. Present the aggregated output to the user with interpretation.
3. If the user needs detail on specific items after seeing the summary, use `query_library` with targeted filters for just those items.

### Example: "give me an overview of my library"
```javascript
const items = await Zotero.Items.getAll(env.libraryID, false, false, false);
const byYear = {};
const byType = {};
const byTag = {};
let total = 0;
for (const item of items) {
  if (!item.isRegularItem()) continue;
  total++;
  const year = String(item.getField('date') || '').slice(0, 4) || 'unknown';
  byYear[year] = (byYear[year] || 0) + 1;
  byType[item.itemType] = (byType[item.itemType] || 0) + 1;
  for (const tag of item.getTags()) {
    byTag[tag.tag] = (byTag[tag.tag] || 0) + 1;
  }
}
env.log(JSON.stringify({ total, byYear, byType, byTag }, null, 2));
```

### Key rules
- NEVER page through `query_library` to collect all items — it will overflow the context.
- A single `zotero_script(mode:'read')` can process thousands of items because only the final summary is returned.
- If the user asks about a specific collection, filter by collection inside the script using `Zotero.Collections.get(collectionId).getChildItems()`.
- Keep `env.log()` output concise — aggregate, don't list every item.
- Use `query_library` only for targeted follow-up detail (e.g. "show me the 5 oldest papers").
